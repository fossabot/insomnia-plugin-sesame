Insomnia plugin to open responses using the default software on your system

### SECURITY WARNING
Please exercise caution when using this plugin! 
It will just save whatever the server returns in a temp file and open that using the default app on your machine.
It will happily run executables on your computer if that's what the server returns.

The author *strongly* recommends you only use this to plugin to test servers running locally on your machine.
